## introduction
Machine Learning is a subset of AI which uses statistical methods to enable machines to improve with experiences.
Deep Learning is a part of Machine learning, which makes the computation of multi-layer neural networks feasible. It takes advantage of neural networks to simulate human-like decision making.
The finance team at Rossmann Pharmaceuticals wants to forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time so that, forecasting the sales prediction using machine learning and deep learning as well as exploring the customer purchasing behavior is to be conducted and draw conclusion in this project.
